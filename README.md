# Sequoia-NIR-to-Turbidity
Extracting turbidity (in FNU) from Sequoia NIR images

Code is adapted from https://github.com/marrs-lab/ocean_color and https://github.com/rasmusfenger/micasense_imageprocessing_sequoia.

```Sequoia Image Processing and Turbidity Analysis``` takes in raw NIR Sequoia images, converts to reflectance, and then uses reflectance to calculate turbidity.
